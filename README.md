<!-- The main aim of this project was to create a custom peer to peer network. The user acting as the
client has total flexibility on how to batch the tasks and the user acting as the server has complete
flexibility on tracking the container's usages and killing the containers at any point of time. -->
<!-- The objective is to allow users to self host servers in easier
and abstracted manner. The main aim of this project was to create a custom peer to peer network for distributed computing. The user acting as the client has total flexibility on how to batch the tasks to any of nodes in networks. These nodes can anywhere from personal
computers behind NAT to custom hardware for running custom workload. The aim to provide
access to Heterogeneous set of nodes as a singular global list and abstract away the networking details giving the user focus on designing a custom orchestrator based
on the requirements of a user.  -->

This project aims to simplify self-hosting servers and streamline the creation of distributed systems. The primary focus is to enable users to design custom peer-to-peer networks for distributed computing, offering full flexibility and control while abstracting away the complexities of networking.

## Key Features
Simplified Self-Hosting
Empower users to easily host nodes, whether on personal computers behind NAT, custom hardware, or cloud-based infrastructure.

### Custom Peer-to-Peer Networks
Build a decentralised network tailored to user requirements, enabling distributed task execution without the need for in-depth networking knowledge.

### Heterogeneous Node Support
Harness a diverse array of nodes from personal computers to specialised hardwareâ€”seamlessly integrated into a global node list.

### Abstracted Networking Layer
Networking details are completely abstracted, enabling users to focus on developing bespoke task orchestration systems. No more manual configuration of IPs, ports, or connection logic.

### Flexible Task Distribution
Users acting as clients retain full control over how tasks are batched and assigned to nodes, creating endless possibilities for optimising performance based on specific use cases.

## Setup with Nix
- Ensure you have the nix package manager installed.
- Add the following to your .bashrc file.
```bash
alias p2prc='env P2PRC=<path you want the configs to exist in> nix run github:akilan1999/p2p-rendering-computation --'
```
- Check if it's successful
```bash
p2prc -h
```

## Introduction
This project aims to create a peer to peer (p2p) network, where a user can use the p2p network to act as a client (i.e sending tasks) or the server (i.e executing the tasks). A prototype application will be developed, which comes bundled with a p2p module and possible to execute docker containers or virtual environments across selected nodes.

### Objectives
- Background review on peer to peer network, virtual environments, decentralized rendering tools and tools to batch any sort of tasks.
- Creating p2p network
- Server to create a containerised environment
- The client node to run tasks on Server containerised node -->

<!-- ## Extend your application with P2PRC
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/Akilan1999/p2p-rendering-computation/abstractions"
)

func main() {
	_, err := abstractions.Init(nil)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	// start p2prc
	_, err = abstractions.Start()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	// Run server till termination
	for {

	}
}

``` -->

<!-- ### Export once this is added export P2PRC as environment paths
```
export P2PRC=<PROJECT PATH>
export PATH=<PROJECT PATH>:${PATH}
```

## Installation from source
1. Ensure the Go compiler is installed
   ```
   go version
   ```
3. Ensure docker is installed (Should run without sudo)
   ```
   docker ps
   ```
3. Clone this repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Akilan1999/p2p-rendering-computation
   ```
4. Install and build the project
   ```
   make install
   ```
- If you look closely you will get outputs such as:
   ```
   // Add them to your .bashrc file
   export P2PRC=/<path>/p2p-rendering-computation
   export PATH=/<path>/p2p-rendering-computation:${PATH}
   ```

5. Test if it works
   ```
   p2prc -h
   ```
   or
   ```
   ./p2prc -h
   ```

## Design Architecture
The design architecture was inspired and based on the linux kernel design. The project is segmented into various modules. Each module is responsible for certain tasks in the project. The modules are highly dependent on each other hence the entire codebase can be considered as a huge monolithic chuck which acts as its own library

[Read more on the Design Architecture](Docs/DesignArchtectureIntro.md)

<br>

## Implementation
The programming language used for this project was Golang. The reason Go lang was chosen was because it is a compiled language. The entire codebase is just a single binary file. When distributing to other linux distributing the only requirement would be the binary file to run the code. It is easy to write independant modules and be monolithic at the sametime using Go. Using Go.mod makes it very easy to handle external libraries and modularise code. The go.mod name for the project is git.sr.ht/~akilan1999/p2p-rendering-computation.
