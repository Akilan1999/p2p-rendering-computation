This project aims to simplify self-hosting servers and streamline the
creation of distributed systems. The primary focus is to enable users to
design custom peer-to-peer networks for distributed computing, offering
full flexibility and control while abstracting away the complexities of
networking.

** Key Features
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: key-features
:END:
Simplified Self-Hosting Empower users to easily host nodes, whether on
personal computers behind NAT, custom hardware, or cloud-based
infrastructure.

*** Custom Peer-to-Peer Networks
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: custom-peer-to-peer-networks
:END:
Build a decentralised network tailored to user requirements, enabling
distributed task execution without the need for in-depth networking
knowledge.

*** Heterogeneous Node Support
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: heterogeneous-node-support
:END:
Harness a diverse array of nodes from personal computers to specialised
hardware---seamlessly integrated into a global node list.

*** Abstracted Networking Layer
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: abstracted-networking-layer
:END:
Networking details are completely abstracted, enabling users to focus on
developing bespoke task orchestration systems. No more manual
configuration of IPs, ports, or connection logic.

*** Flexible Task Distribution
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: flexible-task-distribution
:END:
Users acting as clients retain full control over how tasks are batched
and assigned to nodes, creating endless possibilities for optimising
performance based on specific use cases.

  ## Introduction
  This project aims to create a peer to peer (p2p) network, where a user can use the p2p network to act as a client (i.e sending tasks) or the server (i.e executing the tasks). A prototype application will be developed, which comes bundled with a p2p module and possible to execute docker containers or virtual environments across selected nodes.

  ### Objectives
  - Background review on peer to peer network, virtual environments, decentralized rendering tools and tools to batch any sort of tasks.
  - Creating p2p network
  - Server to create a containerised environment
  - The client node to run tasks on Server containerised node -->

:END:
#+begin_src go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/Akilan1999/p2p-rendering-computation/abstractions"
)

func main() {
    _, err := abstractions.Init(nil)

  ## Installation from source
  1. Ensure the Go compiler is installed
     ```
     go version
     ```
  3. Ensure docker is installed (Should run without sudo)
     ```
     docker ps
     ```
  3. Clone this repository
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/Akilan1999/p2p-rendering-computation
     ```
  4. Install and build the project
     ```
     make install
     ```
  - If you look closely you will get outputs such as:
     ```
     // Add them to your .bashrc file
     export P2PRC=/<path>/p2p-rendering-computation
     export PATH=/<path>/p2p-rendering-computation:${PATH}
     ```

  5. Test if it works
     ```
     p2prc -h
     ```
     or
     ```
     ./p2prc -h
     ```

  ## Design Architecture
  The design architecture was inspired and based on the linux kernel design. The project is segmented into various modules. Each module is responsible for certain tasks in the project. The modules are highly dependent on each other hence the entire codebase can be considered as a huge monolithic chuck which acts as its own library

  [Read more on the Design Architecture](Docs/DesignArchtectureIntro.md)

  <br>

  ## Implementation
  The programming language used for this project was Golang. The reason Go lang was chosen was because it is a compiled language. The entire codebase is just a single binary file. When distributing to other linux distributing the only requirement would be the binary file to run the code. It is easy to write independant modules and be monolithic at the sametime using Go. Using Go.mod makes it very easy to handle external libraries and modularise code. The go.mod name for the project is git.sr.ht/~akilan1999/p2p-rendering-computation.
