** Abstract

This project focuses on creating a framework on running heavy tasks that
a regular computer cannot run easily such as graphically demanding video
games, rendering 3D animations , protein folding simulations. In this
project the major focus will not be on the financial incentive part. A
peer to peer network will be created to help run tasks decentrally,
increasing bandwidth for running tasks. To ensure the tasks in the peer
to peer network do not corrupt the server 0S (Operating System), they
will be executed in a virtual environment in the server.

The main aim of this project was to create a custom peer to peer
network. The user acting as the client has total flexibility on how to
batch the tasks and the user acting as the server has complete
flexibility on tracking the container's usages and killing the
containers at any point of time.

** Motivation

:END:
Many of the users rely on our PC / Laptop or servers that belong to a
server farm to run heavy tasks and with the demand of high creativity
requires higher computing power. Buying a powerful computer every few
years to run a bunch of heavy tasks which are not executed as frequently
to reap the benefits can be inefficient utilization of hardware. On the
other end, renting servers to run these heavy tasks can be really
useful. Ethically speaking this is leading to monopolisation of
computing power similar to what is happening in the web server area. By
using peer to peer principles it is possible to remove the
monopolisation factor and increase the bandwidth between the client and
server.
