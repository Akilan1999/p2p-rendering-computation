* Client Module Implementation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: client-module-implementation
:END:
The Client Module interacts with the P2P module and Server Module. It is
responsible for interacting with the server module and appropriately
updating the IP table on the client side. It connects to the server
using the server's REST Apis. It is also the primary decision maker on
how the IP table is updated is on the client side. This is because each
user can have requirements like how many number of hops they would want
to do to update their IP table. Hops is the number of times the client
is going to download the IP table from different servers ,once it gets
the IP tables from the previous servers.

This section focuses in depth on how the client module works. The client
module is incharge of communicating with different servers based on the
IP addresses provided to the user. The IP addresses are derived from
peer to peer modules. The objective here is how the client module
interacts with peer to peer module and server module.

*** Updating the IP table
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: updating-the-ip-table
:END:
The client module calls the peer to peer module to get the local IP
table initially, Based on the servers IP addresses available it calls
the speedtest function from the peer to peer module to update IP
addresses with information such as latencies, download and upload
speeds. Once this is done the client module does a Rest Api call to the
server to download its IP Table. Once the hops are done it writes the
appropriate results to the Local IP table. Once this is done it prints
out the results. To derive parameters such as current the public IP
address the url "http://ip-api.com/json/" was called. This url returns
json response of the current public IP address. This feature will be
used in the future to ensure that the user's current IP address will not
be used for a speed test. Clients IP table is updated to the server
using a form of type multipart.

*** Reading server specifications
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: reading-server-specifications
:END:
The client module calls the route /server_specs and reads the json
response. If the json response was successful then it just calls the
pretty print function which just prints the json output in the terminal.

*** Client creating and removing container
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: client-creating-and-removing-container
:END:
The client module uses the servers Rest apis to create and delete
containers. To create a container the client requires 3 parameters being
the server ip address, the number of the ports the user wants to open
and if the user wants it connected to the GPU or not. The 3 parameters
are sent as a GET request to the server and the server responds with a
json file which has information such as the container ID, ports open ,
SSH username, SSH password, VNC username and VNC password. At the moment
the username and password are hard coded from the server side for both
SSH and VNC. To remove a container the client module only requires the
server IP address and the container ID. The client prints the response
from the server Rest api.

*** Tracking Containers
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tracking-containers
:END:
Clients create docker images in multiple machines. This means if the
client (i.e user) has many containers created there needs to be a way to
track them. To track containers there is a file called
=trackcontainers.json= which tracks all the containers running. The
snippet below show a sample structure of file =trackcontainer.json=.

#+begin_example
{
    "TrackContainer": [
        {
            "ID": "<ID>",
            "Container": {<docker.DockerVM struct>},
            "IpAddress": "<IP Address>"
        }
    ]
} 
#+end_example

The default path to the container tracker is
=client/trackcontainers/trackcontainers.json=.

*** Grouping Containers
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: grouping-containers
:END:
When starting a set container possibility to be able to group them. The
benefit this would be that when executing plugins the group ID would be
enough to execute plugin in a set of containers. This provides the
possibility to execute repetitive tasks in containers in a single cli
command. To store groups there is a file called
=grouptrackcontainer.json= which tracks all the groups currently present
set by the client. The snippet below show a sample structure of file
=grouptrackcontainer.json=.

#+begin_example
{
 "Groups": [
  {
   "ID": "grp<Random UUID>",
   "TrackContainer": [{client.TrackContainers struct}]
  }
 ]
}
#+end_example

The default path to the container tracker is
=client/trackcontainers/grouptrackcontainer.json=.

#+begin_quote
[!NOTE] The group id will be auto-generated and will have its own prefix
in the start which will mostly be =grp<UUID>=.\\
When a container is removed using the command.
=p2prc --rm <IP Address> --id <Container id>=. It will be automatically
deleted from the groups it exists in.
