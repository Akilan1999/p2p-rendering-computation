** Introduction
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: introduction
:END:
The plugin module is designed to ensure clients can execute instructions
in a declarative manner across different containers created. This means
the user (i.e client) needs to write the instruction only once, and
these instructions can be executed across different nodes in a
repetitive manner.

In the scenario of this project Ansibles will be used as the way the
users can create these instructions.

- [[file:Installation.md#Using-Plugins][Setup instruction]]

The plugin module introduces a new path to the config file known as
pluginpath. This path by defaults points to =${P2PRC}/plugin/deploy=.
Any file/folder inside =plugin/deploy= is part of the .gitginore.
Plugins are detected by folder names inside the =plugin/deploy=.

#+begin_example
plugin
|___ Deploy 
       |___<plugin name>
                |___ site.yml 
                |___ hosts
                |___ ports.json
                |___ description.txt 
              .
              . 
              .
              n: n number of plugins possible 
#+end_example

** Site File Template
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: site-file-template
:END:
The site file is also known as the Ansible playbook and is incharge of
executing instructions in a declarative manner. The below example
specifies how to make one.

#+begin_example
- hosts: all

  tasks:
    - name: <task name> 
      <ansible task> 
      debug:
        msg: <debug message> 
#+end_example

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_intro.html#about-playbooks

** Hosts file
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: hosts-file
:END:
hosts file is also known as the inventory file. This file consists of
all the information required to connect to other nodes to execute
Ansible instructions. In this project this file needs to be set in a
certain configuration because the go code or binary will populate this
file automatically with the appropriate information required to connect
to local or remote containers.

#+begin_quote
[!NOTE] Add as exactly specified below:

#+begin_example
all:
 vars:
   ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3 // Path to your python 3 interpreter 
main:
 hosts:
   host1:
     // Note: These values will be automatically overwritten 
     // by the Go functions 
     ansible_host: 0.0.0.0 
     ansible_port: 39269
     ansible_user: master
     ansible_ssh_pass: password
     ansible_sudo_pass: password
#+end_example

#+end_quote

** Ports.json
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: ports.json
:END:
The =ports.json= file is intended to mention the number of ports
required by the plugin.

#+begin_example
{
  "NumOfPorts": <number of ports>
}
#+end_example

** Description file
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: description-file
:END:
This is a simple text file used to describe what the module does. When
the client is looking at various commands via the ClI. The description
is displayed along-side the plugin name.

Ex: When the flag =--ViewPlugins= or =--vp= is called

#+begin_example
{
    "PluginsDetected": [
        {
            "FolderName": "<name of the plugin>",
            "PluginDescription": "<description of the plugin>"
        }
    ]
} 
#+end_example

** Automatic port allocations
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: automatic-port-allocations
:END:
P2PRC would be in-charge to set to the ports to various TCP ports
opened. Due to this implementation the plugin being executed is copied
to the tmp directory with a unique UUID.

#+begin_example
Command: ls /tmp
output: Semantic <UUID>_<Plugin Name> 
2e6d76c4-0ed1-4b55-9385-79a58d4f0492_p2prc-vscode-browser                
7b631e08-62ee-4c1c-a2a4-c05857b9aa7d_p2prc-vscode-browser
#+end_example

Once the copy of the plugin is added to the /tmp directory the site.yml
file inside the appropriate yaml is modified with the appropriate ports
assigned to the container.

*** Ex:
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: ex
:END:
1. Create container called c1 with an automatic generated TCP port 3313
   (external) - 3313 (internal)
2. Assumption of plugin p1 exists. p1 has one server which needs to be
   mapped to a free open TCP port in container c1. Below shows an
   implementation of a sample site.yml file.

#+begin_example
---
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: start vscode code server
      shell: sh server.sh 0.0.0.0:{{index . 0}}
#+end_example

Notice there is the following {{index . 0}}. {{index . 0}} does not
belong to Ansible but rather is a way to mention where to add the
external free port of the container. We use the golang
[[https://pkg.go.dev/text/template][template library]] to parse and
populate the site.yml with the appropriate open ports. An array of ints
which consists of open free ports are sent to the site.yml. 0 in
{{index . 0}} refers to the index in the int array passed on.

After the port is automatically it's ready to run !

#+begin_example
---
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: start vscode code server
      shell: sh server.sh 0.0.0.0:3313
#+end_example

** Pull Plugins
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: pull-plugins
:END:
The following allows us to pull plugins from a remote git repository and
store them in the default plugins directory. The implementation uses a
Go git library to pull the git repo and automatically save it as a
folder in the plugin path.

** Delete Plugins
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: delete-plugins
:END:
We delete the plugin folder based on the plugin name provided as an
argument on the cli command. Once the folder is deleted, the plugin
manager automatically knows that the plugin does not exist anymore.
